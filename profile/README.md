<h1 align="center">Obol: Distributed Validators For Ethereum</h1>

Welcome to the Obol GitHub!

The Obol GitHub is a collection of software which enables the Obol Distributed Validators. (DVs) This includes repositories for documentation, the DV middleware client Charon, tools for running a DV node or DV cluster via Docker, and more. Please see the links below. 

## About Obol

The Obol Collective is a collection of tools, teams, and communities dedicated to scaling Ethereum by strengthening the security, resiliency, and decentralisation of the consensus layer through the development and deployment of distributed validators. The Distributed Validator middleware client, Charon, boosts the security, resilience, and decentralisation of the Ethereum validator network by enabling “squad staking”. The Collective is fueled by Obol’s economic model, which directs 1% of staking rewards from DVs to ecosystem projects via retroactive funding - a positive flywheel to accelerate adoption of DVs and scale the consensus layer.
